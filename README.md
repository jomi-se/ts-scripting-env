# TypeScript Scripting environment

Basic NodeJS project setup for TypeScript.

It is meant for writting small one-off toy scripts with eslint and prettier checking.

Jest is included if you want to use it to test out your scripts.

Also includes [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) and [bignumber.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bignumber.js) as utility libraries.

I use this when writing solutions to algorithm exercises or when trying out simple stuff.

## Usage

Add Typescript files and run with `yarn run:script <filepath>`

Yuo can start node in debugger mode with `yarn run:script:debug <filepath>`
